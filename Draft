# Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Database Project

This project allows users to track their Fantasy Premier League (FPL) teams, players' statistics (e.g., expected goals, assists, clean sheets), and convert these stats into FPL points. The project integrates with the FPL API to fetch real-time data for players, teams, and fixtures. The system calculates and stores the points for each player based on FPL's official point allocation system.
